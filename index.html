			<h2>Hair Journey</h2>
				<p>I was working in manufacturing when I decided I wanted to persue my dreams to be a hairstylist. I started my journey doing hair over 6 years ago at Mitchell Community College. Once I was out of school, I took the time in a commission salon to learn the skills that I carry with me today. Wanting to offer clients a better experience, I left to be my own boss! I now rent a chair at Full Glam Beauty Bar and work next to some of the best girls in the business. I am excited to continue to grow in my skills and to meet many more people in the community!
				</p>
			<h2>Products and Favorite Services</h2>
				<p>I use Wella Professional Color, and MoroccanOil for all styling products. There is always a stock of MoroccanOil products available for purchase at the salon.<br>
				My favorite services include lived-in colors, such as balayage, as well as traditional foil highlights!</p>
			<h2>Outside of the Salon</h2>
				<p>When I am not in the salon I am at home with my amazing husband, two cats, and two dogs. There is never a dull moment with our house full of animals!</p>

			<h2>Color<h2>
				<h3>Balayage - $155</h3>
					<p>My most requested service - balayage is a highlighting placement that is perfect for those who want a seamless grow out. It leaves some natural root, and brightens around the face and ends of the hair. It is a lived-in look that can be customized for each clientâ€™s needs. Service comes with balayage, toning gloss and style.</p>
				<h3>Highlight - $105 to $165</h3>
					<p>Full, Extra Full or Partial Highlight - to add maximum brightness to the hair for those who want to be blonde! This is also great for blending grey. 
				Partial highlights covers the part and hairline. $105
				Full covers the head. $130
				Extra full covers the head with minimum hair left out to achieve a more all over blonde color. $165
				Service includes highlight, toning gloss and style.

				<h3>All Over Color - $115</h3>
					<p>Going darker with 1 all over color. Style included</p>
				<h3>Color Melt - $155</h3>
					<p>Color melting is a great way to add depth back into the hair. This allows you to go darker with 1-3 different levels of a color to maintain dimension. Colors are melted darker color towards the root, and panels of different levels throughout to give you a lived-in darker color. 
				Service includes color and style.</p>

				<br>
				<h2>Treatments</h2>
				<h3>Fusion Plex - $30-$50</h3>
					<p>Fusion Plex is an in-salon treatment made by Wella. It is a protein + moisturizing treatment that infuses the hair with amino acids that are missing due to color, brushing, tangles. It is topped with a moisturizing mask to keep the hair soft. This treatment lasts 8+ weeks. Highly recommended for color clients.
				$55 - Stand alone with blow dry and style
				$30 - Added to color or haircut</p>
				<h3>Conditioning Treatment - $20-$40</h3>
					<p>Pack in the moisture with a conditioning treatment! I have 4 different products and will choose one based on your specific hair type. 
				$45 - Stand alone with blow dry and style
				$20 - Added to color or haircut</p>
				<h3>Keratin Smoothing Treatment - $200+</h3>
					<p>Global Keratin Smoothing Treatment is a long lasting treatment for easier management of the hair. This 2 hour in-salon treatment makes the hair easier to blow dry smooth for 3-5 months (depending on how often you shampoo). While it does smooth and decrease tangles and frizz, it does not completely straighten the hair - so you can still wear your hair curly should you wish! The treatment packs your hair with proteins which help with breakage in the long run. It is also progressive, so you will see better results with each treatment you get.
				Starting at $200 - increases depending on the hair thickness and length</p>
				<h2>Waxing</h2>
					<p>Brow/Lip/Chin - $12 each</p>
				<h2>Style</h2>
				<h3>Blowdry & Style - $30</h3>
					<p>Shampoo, blow-dry and style.</p>
				<h3>Dry Style - $15</h3>
					<p>Come in with hair clean and dry, and I will pop in some curls or beach waves!</p>
